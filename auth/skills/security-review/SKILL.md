description: Security and privacy review of a pesu-auth change - credential and personal-data exposure in logs, errors, metrics and responses, session isolation, input validation, token comparison, label-cardinality DoS, upstream abuse and dependency vulnerabilities - with tests proving each concern. Use for every change to request handling, logging, auth, upstream code or dependencies.

# Security review

Threat model and controls: `.agents/pesu-skills/auth/docs/security.md`. pesu-auth sees students'
PESU passwords on every request; the bar is "cannot leak, even by accident".

## 1. Map the data flows in the diff

For every changed line that reads a request, a header, upstream HTML/cookies, or writes a log, an
exception message, a metric label, a response field or a file, note what data can flow through it.

## 2. Check each flow

| Question                                                           | How to check                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Can a password reach a log, exception message, metric or response? | Follow `password`/`j_password`/body from `RequestModel` to every sink; check `logging.*` calls and f-strings in the diff |
| Is any new personal data (name, email, phone, PRN) logged?         | Search 1 below; existing INFO profile logging is a known issue, not permission to add more                               |
| Are tokens (CSRF, METRICS_TOKEN, cookies) logged or returned?      | Same search; never log them                                                                                              |
| Could two callers share a session?                                 | Clients taken from the cache under the lock and closed after one login (`change-upstream-client`)                        |
| Is new input validated strictly?                                   | Pydantic model with `strict=True`, `extra="forbid"`; lengths or formats constrained where it matters                     |
| Can a caller create unbounded metric series or memory growth?      | Labels from closed sets only; no per-user or per-path caches                                                             |
| Can a caller make us hammer PESU?                                  | No retries in loops, no fan-out per request                                                                              |
| Secret comparison                                                  | `secrets.compare_digest` on bytes, as in `app/metrics/auth.py`                                                           |
| Error detail leakage                                               | 500s generic; upstream text not forwarded to callers                                                                     |
| New endpoint exposure                                              | Should it be open? Operational data should use the `METRICS_TOKEN` pattern; `/health` stays open                         |
| Secrets in code, tests, fixtures, docs, commits                    | Search 2 below; read every hit                                                                                           |

Searches over the diff:

```bash
git diff upstream/dev...HEAD | rg -n "logging\.(info|warning|error|exception|debug)"   # 1. new log calls
git diff upstream/dev...HEAD | rg -in "password|token|secret|PES[12][0-9]{3}"           # 2. secrets and PRNs
```

## 3. Prove it

Write tests for the risky flows, for example:

```python
def test_validation_errors_do_not_log_the_password(client, caplog):
    with caplog.at_level("DEBUG"):
        client.post("/authenticate", json={"username": "u", "password": "hunter2", "profile": "yes"})
    assert "hunter2" not in caplog.text
```

## 4. Dependencies

If `pyproject.toml` or `uv.lock` changed:

```bash
uvx --python 3.14 pip-audit --strict --require-hashes --disable-pip -r <(uv export --frozen --no-dev --no-emit-project)
```

Check new packages for maintenance, popularity, license (MIT compatible) and install-time code.

## 5. Report

Findings with severity (`critical|high|medium|low`), the data or abuse involved, the failure
scenario and the fix. If you find an exploitable vulnerability (in the change or existing code),
**do not** put details in a commit, PR, issue or CI log: report it only to the human and point to
`.github/SECURITY.md`.
