description: Bring pesu-auth documentation in step with behaviour - README sections and examples, OpenAPI examples in app/docs, CONTRIBUTING, .env.example, docstrings and why-comments - and format it with mdformat. Use after any behaviour, configuration, metrics, workflow or tooling change, or for documentation-only fixes.

## Steps

1. List what the change alters. For each item, search every place above:
   `rg -n "<field|message|metric|flag>" README.md .github app`.
1. Edit each place. Keep the existing voice: direct, precise, explains why, no marketing. README
   examples must be copy-pasteable and match real output (run the request and paste the real shape,
   with personal values replaced by the placeholder values already used: `PES1201800001`,
   `John Doe`, `johndoe@gmail.com`, `1234567890`).
1. Swagger examples in `app/docs/` must validate against their models:
   `uv run pytest tests/unit/test_openapi_docs.py -q`.
1. Format Markdown: `uv run pre-commit run mdformat --all-files` (it rewrites tables and list
   numbering; commit what it produces).
1. Look at Swagger (`run-locally`, then `http://localhost:5000/`) for any route you touched.

## Rules

- Document only what the code does. If the docs and code disagree and the task is not about that,
  note it in `docs/known-issues.md` in pesu-dev/skills or the PR rather than guessing.
- Do not reorganise README sections as a side effect of another change.
- Never include real credentials, tokens or personal data in examples.
- Doc-only changes still bump the version (every PR does): `docs:` commit type.
