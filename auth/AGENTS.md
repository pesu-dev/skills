# pesu-auth

Instructions for coding agents working in the pesu-auth repository (`pesu-dev/auth`). Read this
file first; it tells you where everything else is.

pesu-auth is a small, stateless FastAPI service that authenticates PESU students against PESU
Academy (by driving its web login) and optionally returns their scraped profile. It has no database;
PESU Academy is its only dependency. It is public, used by other student projects, and deployed on
Render: production `https://pesu-auth.onrender.com`, staging `https://pesu-auth-dev.onrender.com`.

## Where the agent material lives

Everything below is in the `.agents/pesudev-skills` git submodule (the pesu-dev/skills repository).
If `.agents/pesudev-skills` is empty, run `git submodule update --init` first.

| What                    | Path                                           | Use                                              |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Skills (task playbooks) | `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`               | Load the one that matches the task (index below) |
| Reference docs          | `.agents/pesudev-skills/auth/docs/<name>.md`   | Deep background, read on demand                  |
| Roles                   | `.agents/pesudev-skills/auth/agents/<role>.md` | Personas for each phase of autonomous work       |

Short references such as `docs/testing.md` in this file, the skills and the roles always mean
`.agents/pesudev-skills/auth/docs/testing.md`; any other path is relative to the repository root.

Never edit `AGENTS.md` or `.agents/` in this repository. They come from
pesu-dev/skills; changes go there as a PR. Never edit `.github/agents/` by hand either: it is
generated from the roles by `uv run python scripts/sync_agents.py`, and a pre-commit hook fails when
it is out of date.

## Quick reference

```bash
uv sync --all-groups                         # install everything (Python 3.14, via uv)
cp .env.example .env                         # then fill TEST_* for live tests (never commit .env)
uv run pre-commit install                    # hooks run on commit
uv run python -m app.app --debug             # serve on http://localhost:5000 (Swagger at /)
uv run python scripts/run_tests.py           # canonical test run, coverage gate 95%
uv run pytest tests/unit -q                  # fast offline tests
uv run pre-commit run --all-files            # everything CI runs
uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check .
docker build . --tag pesu-auth && docker run --rm -p 5000:5000 pesu-auth
```

## Rules that always apply

1. **Never log, print, store or echo a password, token or new personal data.** Not in logs,
   exceptions, metrics labels, test output, commits, PRs or reports. The username and profile are
   logged at INFO by design, for tracing; that is not a defect. (`docs/security.md`)
1. **Errors are exceptions.** Raise a `PESUAcademyError` subclass; the handlers render
   `{status, message, timestamp}`. Validation failures are 400, never 422 (422 means the profile
   page could not be parsed).
1. **The API contract is camelCase, strict and documented.** Models use `alias_generator=to_camel`,
   `strict=True`, and request models `extra="forbid"`. Every route has tags, a docstring and an
   `app/docs/` module; `tests/unit/test_openapi_docs.py` enforces it. (`docs/api-contract.md`)
1. **Every upstream call** goes through `_upstream_call` and every `httpx2.AsyncClient` is closed on
   every path, including cancellation. (`docs/architecture.md`)
1. **Metric labels are bounded** and each fact is recorded in exactly one layer. (`docs/metrics.md`)
1. **Code style is enforced**: Google docstrings and full annotations on everything in `app/`,
   ruff with line length 120, comments explain *why*. (`docs/conventions.md`)
1. **Tests**: add tests with every change, keep coverage at 100% (gate 95%), follow the fixture
   recipes in `docs/testing.md`.
1. **Live tests use one PESU session**: never run two live test runs at once, never with `-n`.
   A run without credentials is partial and must be reported as partial.
1. **Every PR bumps `version` in `pyproject.toml` exactly once** and runs `uv lock`. Minor by
   default; major for breaking changes.
1. **Docs move with behaviour**: README, `app/docs/`, CONTRIBUTING and comments are updated in the
   same PR as the change they describe.

## Contribution workflow

Fork → branch from `upstream/dev` → change + tests → pre-commit green → version bump → PR to
`pesu-dev/auth` **`dev`** from the fork (never from `main`, never to `main`). Conventional Commits
(`feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `chore:`, `!` for breaking) with bodies that explain
why. Merges to `dev` deploy to staging; production is deployed manually by maintainers.
(`docs/ci-cd.md`)

## Working autonomously

You may take a task all the way to an **open pull request** without a human. You may not merge,
push to `dev`/`main` or `pesu-dev/auth`, trigger deploys, change repository settings, or weaken
checks. Stop and hand back when a change is breaking or security-sensitive beyond what was asked,
needs new secrets or infrastructure, or a check still fails after three attempts. Start with the
`implement-feature` skill; the full lifecycle, definition of done and report format are in
`.agents/pesudev-skills/auth/docs/autonomous-workflow.md`. As GitHub Copilot's cloud agent, read
its "Copilot's cloud agent" section first: that agent opens its own pull request and runs behind a
firewall.

## Skills

Each skill is `.agents/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`. If your tool loads skills from `.agents/skills`, use
them that way; otherwise, when a task matches a row below, open that `SKILL.md` and follow it.

| `diagnose-production`    | Production or staging misbehaves; reading `/metrics` and status pages          |

## Roles

In `.agents/pesudev-skills/auth/agents/`. Start each as a sub-agent if your tool supports it;
otherwise follow the file yourself for that phase. In GitHub Copilot each role is also a custom
agent (`.github/agents/<role>.agent.md`), selectable from the agent picker.

| Role                    | Does                                                                     |

| `implementer`           | Writes the code to the plan, test-first                                  |
| `test-engineer`         | Designs and writes tests, runs the suites, owns coverage                 |
| `reviewer`              | Independent correctness and quality review of the diff (read-only)       |
