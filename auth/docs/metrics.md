# Metrics

pesu-auth exposes in-process counters at `/metrics`. The README section "`/metrics`" is the full
public reference (every family, its meaning, the accounting rules, both payload examples). This
file is the maintainer's view: where metrics are recorded, the rules they follow, and everything
that must change together when one is added.

## Where each metric is recorded

| Layer               | File                        | Records                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

Record a fact in **exactly one** layer and one family. The middleware and the handlers write to
different families on purpose, so one failed request is one status sample and one error sample.

## Rules

1. **Bounded labels.** A label value must come from a closed set the code controls. Never use a raw
   path, a username, a request field value or an exception message as a label. Caller-controlled
   input is clamped first: `method_label` (unknown verb → `<other>`), `route_label` (unmatched path →
   `<unmatched>`), `KNOWN_REQUEST_FIELDS` (unknown field → `other`). Unbounded labels are a memory
   DoS on a public endpoint.
1. **Declared labels only.** `MetricsCollector._key` raises `ValueError` if the labels passed do not
   exactly match the family's declared `labels` tuple. Tests will catch a mismatch.
1. **Counters only go up**, except the `requests_in_flight` gauge, which is decremented in a
   `finally`.
1. **Monotonic clock** (`time.perf_counter`) for latency; wall clock only for timestamps.
1. **Summaries expose `_sum` and `_count`**, not quantiles.
1. **Unlabelled families are seeded at zero** in `MetricsCollector.__init__`, so they exist from
   the first scrape.
1. **Accounting invariants must keep holding** (they are how an operator decides whether to trust
   the numbers):
   - `requests.success + requests.failed + requestsInFlight == requests.total` (minus abandoned requests)
   - `sum(responsesByStatus) == requests.success + requests.failed`
   - `sum(authenticationResults) == authentication.total` (minus in-flight)
   - `http_clients created - closed == 1` at rest

## Adding a metric: every place it must appear

1. `app/metrics/collector.py`: a `MetricFamily` constant (`f"{METRIC_PREFIX}<name>_total"` for a
   counter, `_seconds` for a duration), documentation string, type, label names; **add it to
   `FAMILIES`** in render order.
1. Record it at the one right layer (table above).
1. `app/models/metrics.py`: a field on `MetricsModel` (or a nested model) with `title`,
   `description`, `json_schema_extra={"example": ...}`, and populate it in `from_snapshot`, casting
   explicitly (`int(...)`, `float(...)`) because the model is strict.
1. `app/docs/metrics.py`: add it to `_PROMETHEUS_EXAMPLE` (HELP, TYPE, one sample) and
   `_JSON_EXAMPLE`. `test_the_documented_prometheus_example_looks_like_the_real_payload` compares
   families with the real payload.
1. `README.md` "`/metrics`": the relevant "What each metric means" table, the full Prometheus
   example and the full JSON example in the `<details>` blocks.
1. Tests: collector and renderer tests if the family type is new, the instrumentation test for the
   code path, and the JSON key set in `tests/unit/test_metrics_endpoints.py::test_json_format_shape`.
1. If a public dashboard or alert depends on it, say so in the PR; the Grafana dashboard linked in the
   README is maintained by hand.

Renaming or removing a metric breaks dashboards and alerts: treat it as a breaking change for the
PR description even though it does not require a major version.
