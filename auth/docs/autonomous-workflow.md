# Autonomous workflow

How an agent takes a piece of work on pesu-auth from request to open pull request without a human
in the loop, and where it must stop. The `implement-feature` skill is the executable version of
this document; this file is the reference for the rules and the role handoffs.

## Boundaries

An agent working autonomously **may**: read anything in the repo; create branches; edit code, tests
and docs; run the app, the tests (live tests one run at a time), linters, Docker builds and
benchmarks against a local instance; commit; push **to the contributor's fork**; open a PR from the
fork to `pesu-dev/auth` `dev`; read CI results and push fixes to its own PR branch.

An agent **must not**: push to `pesu-dev/auth` or to any `dev`/`main` branch; merge, approve or
close PRs it did not open; trigger or call any deploy; change repository settings, secrets or
variables; commit `.env` or any credential; print credentials or personal data; weaken a test, a
coverage gate, a lint rule or a CI check to make something pass; force-push anything except its own
unmerged PR branch.

## Stop and hand back to a human when

- the change is **breaking** (see `docs/api-contract.md`) and the request did not explicitly ask
  for a breaking change;
- the change touches security-sensitive behaviour in a way the request did not spell out (auth,
  logging of personal data, the metrics token), or a vulnerability is found (report privately);
- the work needs a new secret, environment variable, infrastructure, workflow permission, or a new
  runtime dependency the request did not mention;
- the request is ambiguous in a way that changes the design, and the codebase does not settle it;
- the same check still fails after **three** honest fix attempts;
- PESU Academy is down or behaving differently, so the change cannot be verified live;
- live credentials are needed and absent for a change to `app/pesu.py` (finish everything else and
  say the live verification is outstanding).

"Hand back" means: stop making changes, leave the branch in a clean, committed state, and write the
report described below with the exact question or blocker.

## The lifecycle

| #   | Phase        | Role (`.agents/pesudev-skills/auth/agents/`)             | Skills                                             | Exit criterion                                                                                                |

| 5   | Implement    | `implementer` (+ `scraper-specialist` for upstream work) | area skill                                         | Tests pass; code follows `docs/conventions.md`                                                                |

| 7   | Document     | `docs-writer`                                            | `update-docs`                                      | README, OpenAPI docs, CONTRIBUTING and comments match behaviour                                               |
| 8   | Review       | `reviewer`, `security-auditor`                           | `review-change`, `security-review`                 | No blocking findings; every finding fixed or explicitly justified                                             |

| 10  | CI           | `ci-investigator`                                        | `fix-ci`                                           | All PR checks green, or a blocker reported                                                                    |

Loop back from 8 to 5 until the review is clean, and from 10 to 5 when CI finds something. Keep the
plan from phase 2 updated as reality changes it.

### Using roles

The files in `.agents/pesudev-skills/auth/agents/` describe roles. They are plain instructions, not
tied to any tool:

- If your tool can start a separate sub-agent, start one per role and give it the role file's
  contents plus the inputs the role lists. Run the reviewer and security auditor as separate
  sub-agents from the implementer: a fresh context reviews more honestly.
- If it cannot, perform the role yourself: read the role file, follow it for that phase, and write
  its output before moving to the next phase.
- In GitHub Copilot, every role is also a custom agent: pick it in the agent picker, or assign an
  issue to it. The custom agent (`.github/agents/<role>.agent.md`) is a generated wrapper that
  tells Copilot to read the role file, so the role file is still what it follows.

## Definition of done

- [ ] Acceptance criteria from triage are met and demonstrated (test names or command output).
- [ ] `uv run python scripts/run_tests.py` passes; coverage ≥ 95% and not lower than before.
- [ ] Live tests run once if the change touches `app/pesu.py` or `/authenticate` and credentials
  exist; otherwise the PR says they were not run.
- [ ] `uv run pre-commit run --all-files` passes.
- [ ] Docker image builds and answers on `/` and `/health` when the change affects runtime,
  dependencies or the `Dockerfile`.
- [ ] README, OpenAPI docs (`app/docs/`), and comments updated for any behaviour change.
- [ ] Review and security review have no open blocking findings.
- [ ] Version bumped exactly once (minor, or major for breaking), `uv.lock` in step.
- [ ] Commits follow Conventional Commits with explanatory bodies.
- [ ] PR opened from the fork to `dev` with the template filled in truthfully.

## Reports

Every role ends with a short written report; the final report to the human is the last one. Use
this shape:

```markdown
## Outcome
<done | blocked | handed back> — one sentence.

## What changed
- <file>: <what and why>

## Verification
- <command> → <result, with counts> (say "partial" if live tests were skipped)

## Open items
- <anything not done, not verified, or needing a decision>
```

Never claim a check passed that was not run, and never omit a failure.
